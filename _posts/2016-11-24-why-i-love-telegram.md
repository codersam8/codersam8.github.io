If you don't know about <a href="https://telegram.org/" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, it is a messaging app like Whatsapp only better. Here are some of the advantages of
Telegram over Whatsapp.

#### **You don't need your phone connected to internet to use <a href="https://web.telegram.org">web telegram</a>**
If you want to use Whatsapp over web, you must have your phone connected to internet too. That is super strange. But Telegram doesn't need that.
#### **You can use same telegram account in more than one device.**
This is one of the most useful features for me. I use telegram from my tablet too. I downloaded telegram app and used the same account.
#### **When you send photos through Telegram, it doesn't reduce the quality.**
Most of the chat services reduce the quality of pictures you send. But not Telegram. In Telegram the pictures transfer without any loss.
#### **You can send any kind of file(pictures, PDF, word, .txt, .el etc.,) over Telegram**
Other chat services only allow you to send images. But not Telegram. With telegram you can send and type of files.
#### **Telegram has stickers!!!!**
Sometimes words are not enough to convey our emotions. Emoticons do a better job at that. Stickers are better than emoticons. Telegram has very cute stickers.
