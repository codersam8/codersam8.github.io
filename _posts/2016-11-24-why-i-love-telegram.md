If you don't know about Telegram, it is a messaging app like Whatsapp only better. Here are some of the advantages of
Telegram over Whatsapp.

- You don't need your phone connected to internet to use web telegram.
- You can have same telegram account from more than one device. For example
  your phone, tablet, laptop app etc.,
- It only sends verification code via SMS only for the first time. All the other times
  it would send to any of the logged account
- Telegram has stickers!!!!
- It displays most used stickers in a line at the bottom in web Telegram.
